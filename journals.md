- today is 1404/04/15 I've started to code this project again, I'm working on the first functions of `accounts` application.
- one hour have been passed, and I've debugged the first two functions. and now I should do these tests on them:
    1- creating a simple user with firstname, lastname, and all credentials [x]
    2- recreating a user with a duplicated username but different email [x]
    3- recreating a user with a duplicated email but different username [x]
    4- uploading a avatar image [x]
